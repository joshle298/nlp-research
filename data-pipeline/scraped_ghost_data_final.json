However, we have been hesitant to fully roll it out because our Baos can disassemble if it is shaken too violently during delivery. It also doesn't keep the Bao as warm. Please bear with us if you receive a Bao that is messier than usual with this option. We are constantly testing and looking to improve, so we can fully transition to a more sustainable option without affecting your experience. Please let us know your experience with compostable packaging. Thank you for being a part of this!",
